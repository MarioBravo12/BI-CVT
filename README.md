# BI-CVT

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) remains a critical global health challenge, particularly in regions with limited access to reliable and affordable diagnostic tools. Electroencephalography (EEG) represents a non-invasive and cost-effective alternative for early detection; however, integrating EEG with structured clinical data in deep learning models remains a key challenge. This study introduces Bi-CVT, a Bimodal Convolutional Vision Transformer designed to enhance AD classification by fusing EEG spectrograms and clinical assessments through a novel cross-attention mechanism. EEG signals are transformed into time-frequency representations via the Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), while neuropsychological and sociodemographic variables are encoded using a one-dimensional convolutional network. A bidirectional cross-attention module enables dynamic interaction between both modalities, allowing spectral patterns to modulate clinical features and vice versa. Evaluated on the BrainLat dataset, Bi-CVT achieves a classification accuracy of 98.4% in distinguishing AD, frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and cognitively normal (CN) individuals, outperforming state-of-the-art unimodal and multimodal models. Moreover, interpretability is ensured through Grad-CAM and Integrated Gradients (IG), highlighting the most relevant spectral bands and clinical features guiding model decisions. These results position Bi-CVT as a scalable, interpretable, and clinically viable tool for neurodegenerative disease screening, especially in resource-constrained environments.
